# Day 1 - Python Basics 🚀

## 📚 Topics Covered
- 📥 Input from the user using `input()`
- 🖨️ Printing to the console with `print()`
- ✂️ String manipulation (concatenation, indexing, etc.)
- 📝 Variable naming conventions
- 📦 Creating and using variables

## 🔍 What I Learned
Today, I revisited the fundamental building blocks of Python. I practiced how to get input from users, display output, manipulate strings, and define variables with meaningful names. I also explored how Python stores and handles variable values.

Some key takeaways:
- Use descriptive variable names for readability
- Python treats all user input as strings unless cast
- String concatenation and formatting are powerful tools for dynamic outputs
