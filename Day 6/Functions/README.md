# Day 6 - Functions & While Loops 🌀🔧

## 📚 Topics Covered
- 🧱 Function declaration (`def`)
- ▶️ Function invocation (calling a function)
- ⬇️ Importance of indentation in Python
- 🔁 `while` loop basics
- 🚫 Infinite loop awareness

## 🔍 What I Learned
Today I explored how to **define and use functions** in Python without arguments. Functions help organize code into reusable blocks. I also got comfortable with the `while` loop, which continues to execute as long as a condition is true.

Key takeaways:
- Functions must be declared before they are called
- Indentation is critical in defining function bodies and loops
- `while` loops are powerful but can lead to infinite loops if not handled properly
