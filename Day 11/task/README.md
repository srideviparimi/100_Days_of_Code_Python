# Day 11 - Blackjack Game 🃏♠️

## 🛠️ Project: Blackjack Game

Today I built a simplified version of the **Blackjack** game using Python. This project involved several key concepts, such as:
- Randomizing card selection
- Managing user input
- Writing game logic for win/lose conditions
- Using lists and functions to handle game mechanics

## 📚 Topics Covered
- 🃏 Card deck representation
- 🔀 Random module to simulate card drawing
- 💻 Game logic for Blackjack
- 🏆 Win/Loss conditions

## 🧠 Key Concepts:
- A **deck** of cards is represented as a list of tuples.
- The **random module** helps us shuffle and deal cards.
- **Functions** to manage game logic, including checking the player's and dealer’s hands.
