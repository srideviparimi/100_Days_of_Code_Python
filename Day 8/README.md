# Day 8 - Caesar Cipher & Function Arguments 🔐🧩

## 📚 Topics Covered
- 🔐 Caesar Cipher Project (basic encryption)
- 🧱 Functions with arguments
- 🔢 Positional vs Keyword arguments
- 📦 Function flexibility and reusability

## 🔍 What I Learned
Today I built a **Caesar Cipher**—a simple encryption algorithm that shifts letters in a message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. To make it work, I learned how to pass arguments to functions and how Python handles them using **positional** and **keyword** formats.

### 🔑 Key Concepts:
- Functions can accept values (arguments) to make them dynamic
- Positional arguments are based on order
- Keyword arguments specify the parameter by name
- Encrypting and decrypting can be handled by the same function with a direction flag
