# Day 14 - Higher Lower Game 🔼🔽📱

## 🎮 Project: Higher Lower Game (Instagram Edition)

In this project, I created a **Higher Lower** style game where the player is shown two personalities and has to guess **who has more Instagram followers**. The data is stored as a **list of dictionaries**, simulating JSON format.

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- 🧾 Hardcoded data in `list` of `dictionaries`
- 🔁 Game loops & score tracking
- 🆚 Comparing two dictionary values
- 👤 Display formatting
- 🎯 User input handling
- ✅ Score incrementing on correct guesses
- ❌ No penalty for wrong answers (score resets to 0)
