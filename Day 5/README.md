# Day 5 - For Loops & Mini Projects 🔁🔐

## 📚 Topics Covered
- 🔁 `for` loops in Python
- 🔢 `range()` function with loops
- 🛠️ Loop-based logic
- 💡 Micro Projects:
  - Finding the highest number in a list
  - Random password generator

## 🔍 What I Learned
Today I explored the **`for` loop**, which is essential for repeating actions over a sequence. I practiced using the `range()` function and applied loops in two practical micro projects to solidify my understanding.

Key lessons:
- `for` loops are great for iterating through lists or ranges of numbers
- `range(start, stop, step)` gives full control over the loop cycle
- Loops make repetitive tasks efficient and clean
