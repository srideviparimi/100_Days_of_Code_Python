# Day 15 - Coffee Machine Project ☕💰🧮

## 🎮 Project: Coffee Machine Simulation

In this project, I built a simple command-line **coffee machine** that:
- Checks if enough **ingredients** are available,
- Verifies if the **payment** is sufficient,
- Calculates and returns **change**, and
- Dispenses a coffee if all checks pass!

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- 📦 Using **functions** for clean code
- 📋 Ingredient checks using **dictionaries**
- 🧾 Coin calculation & change return logic
- 🔁 Using loops for continuous operation
- 🧪 Combining conditionals for complex checks
- 🔍 Debugging logical flow

## 🔧 Functional Features

- ☕ Menu with options: espresso, latte, cappuccino
- 🧮 Accepts user coins: pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters
- 🔄 Reports remaining resources
- ❌ Declines drink if:
  - Not enough ingredients
  - Payment is insufficient
- ✅ Dispenses drink and deducts resources if all conditions pass
- 💲 Tracks profit
