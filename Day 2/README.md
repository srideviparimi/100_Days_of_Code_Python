# Day 2 - Python Data Types & Math 🧮

## 📚 Topics Covered
- 🔢 Python data types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`)
- ➕ Mathematical operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`)
- 🔁 Type conversion (e.g., `int()`, `str()`, `float()`)
- 🛠️ Number manipulation and calculations
- ❗ Common errors and debugging (e.g., `TypeError`, `ValueError`)

## 🔍 What I Learned
Today was all about **understanding how Python handles data** and math. I learned how to use and convert between different data types and perform operations using arithmetic operators. I also encountered a few errors and learned how to fix them through debugging.

Some key insights:
- Mixing strings and numbers directly causes a `TypeError`
- Integer division (`//`) returns whole numbers, while `/` returns a float
- Type conversion is necessary when combining inputs with numeric operations
