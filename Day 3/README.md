# Day 3 - Control Flow & Logic 🔀

## 📚 Topics Covered
- 🧠 `if` statements
- 🔄 `if-else` and `elif` for branching
- 🧩 Nested `if` statements
- ⚖️ Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- ➗ The modulo operator `%`

## 🔍 What I Learned
Today’s focus was on making Python programs **think and decide** using conditionals and logic. I practiced writing conditional branches, combining multiple conditions, and using modulo to solve even/odd or divisibility problems.

Some important lessons:
- Conditions must evaluate to `True` or `False`
- `elif` allows checking multiple conditions cleanly
- Nesting should be used carefully to avoid too much complexity
- Logical operators help create powerful condition checks
