## 🧠 Key Concepts

### 📍 Scope
- **Local Scope**: Variables defined inside a function.
- **Global Scope**: Variables defined outside all functions, accessible globally.
- **Block Scope**: Python doesn't have block scope like some other languages (e.g., inside `if` or `for` blocks — variables are still accessible).

### 🛠 `global` Keyword
- Used to **modify global variables** from inside a function.
- Should be used sparingly and with care to avoid unexpected side effects.
