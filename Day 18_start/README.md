# Day 18 - Spirograph with Turtle & GUI 🌀🐢💻

## 🎨 Project: Spirograph with Turtle and GUI
In this project, I created a **Spirograph** using Python's **Turtle module**. To make it interactive, I added a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** using **Tkinter** to allow users to customize the design.
## 🧠 Topics Covered
- 🐢 Introduction to **Turtle graphics**
- 🖼 Creating spirals and **Spirograph patterns**
- 🖱 Working with **GUI** using **Tkinter**
- 🎨 Allowing dynamic user input (e.g., color, size, speed) via a simple GUI
- 🔄 Looping to create repeated patterns
## 🧩 Key Features of the Project:
1. **Turtle Graphics**: I used the Turtle module to draw various shapes and patterns that form the Spirograph.
2. **GUI for Customization**: The user can:
   - Set the **color** of the spirograph.
   - Adjust the **size** and **speed** of the drawing.
3. **Spirograph Creation**: The turtle moves in a circular path, repeatedly drawing smaller shapes within the larger pattern to create the spirograph effect.
