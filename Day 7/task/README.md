# Day 7 - Hangman Project 🎯💀

## 🛠️ Project: Hangman Game

Today I built a simple version of the classic **Hangman** game in Python! This project helped reinforce everything I’ve learned so far—strings, loops, conditionals, lists, and the `random` module.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Practiced
- 📜 String and list manipulation
- 🔁 `for` and `while` loops
- 🔀 `random.choice()` for selecting a word
- ⌨️ Getting user input
- ✅ Checking win/loss conditions
- 🎮 Tracking guessed letters and game state

## 🧩 Features
- Randomly selects a word from a list
- Takes user guesses one letter at a time
- Tracks correct and incorrect guesses
- Displays blanks and reveals correct letters
- Ends game on win or after limited attempts
