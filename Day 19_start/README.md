# Day 19 - Turtle Race with Tkinter 🐢🏁🚦
## 🎮 Project: Turtle Race Game with Tkinter
In this project, I built a **Turtle Race** game using Python's **Tkinter** module. The game involves multiple turtles racing to a finish line, and the user can start the race with a button click.
The game leverages **instances**, **state management**, and **higher-order functions** to handle the turtles, their movements, and race conditions.
## 🧠 Topics Covered
- 🐢 Working with **Turtle graphics** to animate the race
- 🧳 **Instances and state management** for each turtle's position and speed
- 🔄 **Higher-order functions** to start the race, reset the game, and handle events
- 🎮 Basic game logic: detecting when the race ends and declaring a winner
- 🖱 Creating interactive elements using **Tkinter** (e.g., buttons, labels)
## 🧩 Key Features of the Project:
1. **Multiple Turtles**: Each turtle is an instance of the `Turtle` class with its own state (position and speed).
2. **Race Logic**: The turtles move across the screen, and the first one to cross the finish line wins.
3. **Tkinter GUI**: The user can start the race by pressing a button, and the race is displayed in a window.
4. **Higher-order functions**: Functions like the race start, reset, and movement control are implemented using higher-order functions to pass them as arguments to other functions.
