# 🤖 Day 48 - Introduction to Selenium & Web Automation

Today, I explored **Selenium**, a powerful Python library for automating browser interactions. To practice, I built an automation bot that plays the popular **Cookie Clicker** game by continuously clicking the cookie and (optionally) purchasing upgrades.

## 🛠️ Project: Cookie Clicker Automation

### 💡 What I Built
An automation script using Python and Selenium that:
- Launches a browser window and navigates to the Cookie Clicker game.
- Continuously clicks the cookie to increase the score.
- (Optional) Detects and buys upgrades to speed up cookie production.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 🌐 Introduction to Selenium
- Overview of Selenium and its use in browser automation.
- Setup and installation of `selenium` and ChromeDriver.

### 🔎 Locating Web Elements
- Using `By.ID`, `By.CLASS_NAME`, `By.XPATH` and other selectors to find and interact with HTML elements.

### ⚙️ Browser Automation
- Opening a browser with `webdriver.Chrome()`
- Navigating to a URL with `driver.get()`
- Automating user actions: `.click()`, `.send_keys()`, `.text`

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Web Automation**: Programmatically control a web browser to mimic user interactions.
- **Element Selection**: Locate and interact with elements using their HTML attributes.
- **Loops and Timing**: Use loops and `time.sleep()` to continuously perform tasks like clicking and checking for upgrades.
- **Hands-On Practice**: Applied automation techniques in a real-world browser-based game.
