# Day 9 - Dictionaries, Nesting & Blind Auction Project 💰📦

## 📚 Topics Covered
- 🧩 Python Dictionaries
- 🧠 Nesting: lists in dictionaries, dictionaries in lists, dictionaries in dictionaries
- 🛠️ Blind Auction Project

## 🔍 What I Learned
Today was all about **dictionaries**—Python’s way of storing key-value pairs—and how to work with nested structures. I applied these concepts in a **Blind Auction** project where users can bid anonymously and the program determines the highest bidder.

### 🔑 Key Concepts:
- Creating, accessing, and updating dictionary entries
- Looping through dictionaries
- Nesting complex data types
- Building a simple bidding system using input, logic, and dictionary storage
